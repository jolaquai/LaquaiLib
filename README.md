# LaquaiLib
LaquaiLib is my personal little C# library. It contains mainly extension methods for tons of types.

> ~**Note that the intent of this library is NOT to compile it and reference it in your project. It is set to target .NET 8, Windows only (due to the Forms/WPF references). You are supposed to browse through it and copy whatever classes/functionality you need and just stick it into your own projects. The amount of dependencies (especially transitive dependencies) will just pollute your projects if you reference it.**~

I've made the decision to split the library up into multiple sub-projects, each potentially targeting different runtimes/frameworks so that dependencies are kept to a minimum. This is very much work-in-progress, so expect changes to the structure and content. You can find the packages of those sub-projects on NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/profiles/jolaquai

There is no need to give credit for anything you decide to use in this library. Enjoy!
