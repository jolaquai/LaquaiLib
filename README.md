# LaquaiLib
LaquaiLib is my personal little C# library. In here goes anything I have ever or might ever need, no matter how useless it actually is.

I've been hard at work since [v1.3.8](https://github.com/jolaquai/LaquaiLib/releases/tag/v1.3.8), which has marked the last release that targets only .NET 9. The new version that will release proooobably around the same time as .NET 10... well, it won't be a full-on rewrite, but expect major changes and source incompatibilities.
> A word of caution about this. v1.3.8 is by no means stable. In fact, most of what's in there does not work correctly. If you desperately need stuff from LaquaiLib, I cautiously suggest including the latest "wip"-like branch from the repository, checking what already has tests covering it and using just that portion.

However, along with it comes a massive suite of tests, new features and multi-targeting, ensuring anything that's here a) works, b) keeps working and c) is actually useful. Anything that didn't meet those criteria either got fixed or deleted.

The library is, always has been and will always be in a "state of flux", if you will. Nothing is guaranteed to remain as it was in the previous version because I maintain this for my own use. If you depend on this, maybe stay on one version for a while and don't blindly update. Check diffs between tags, make sure what you're getting yourself into.

There is no need to give credit for anything you decide to use in this library. It is [UNLICENSE](https://unlicense.org/)d and you are free to do whatever you want with it. Just don't blame me if something goes wrong ;)
